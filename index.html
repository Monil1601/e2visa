    <h2>What is E2 Visa?</h2>
    <p class="info">
    E2 is a non-immigrant visa that allows the investor to live and work in the U.S.
    to direct and develop the business, hire domestic and international employees for business management
    and expand the business.
    <br>
    Unlike H1B visa, there is <strong>no quota</strong> for E2 visas. The investment necessary to qualify for E2 Visa depends on <thead>
    the nature of business.
    <br>
    Immediate family members of the E2 Investors - Spouse and children under 21 - can immigrate to the U.S.
    </thead>
    <br>
    The visa is issued for a period of 5 years and has to be renewed every two years. Renewal can be done in the U.S.
    <br>

      <h2>The Issue</h2>
      <p class="info">
        India does not have an E2 treaty with the U.S. because of which Indians do not qualify for the E2 Visa. <br>
        In order to obtain E2 visa, Indians need to acquire citizenship from Grenada. <br>
      </p>

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p class="info">
        <strong>STEP 1:</strong> As authorized International Marketing Agents, we assist you in making investment in a
        real estate project approved by the citizenship by investment committee of Grenada.<br> <br>

        which is a proof of citizenship and we then use it to apply for your new Grenadian passports. <br> <br>

        <strong>STEP 5:</strong> Once you have your Grenadian passports, our immigration attorney would guide you
        in making a business plan (if you don't have one) or legally executing your business plan in order to apply for E2
        visa. <br> <br>

        <strong>STEP 6:</strong> Our Attorney would then prepare the necessary documents and you would be ask to make preliminary investment
        in your business - as a requirement by USCIS - to demonstrate your funds are actively being used. <br> <br>

        <strong>STEP 7:</strong> Once you make investment in your business, your E2 visa application would be filed to the nearest
        U.S. Consulate in your home country. <br> <br>

        <strong>STEP 8:</strong> After approval of the application, U.S. Consulate would schedule a visa interview for the investor
        and their family members. <br> <br>

        <strong>STEP 9:</strong> After getting the visa, investor's family would be able to travel to the U.S. <br> <br>
